					Daily updates was the one of the biggest benefit for me when
					developing the project. It allows us to share updates,
					changes, and ideas in daily meetings over discord. Issues
					are shared and fixed quickly to keep the progress of the
					project running effectively.

					SCRUM was very beneficial to the team in organizing and
					collecting work. I where able to create sprint backlogs on
					Trello. Managing out sprint objectives with priorities and
					easily identify blocking tasks.

					I find SCRUM being very helpful for me, especially sprint
					reviews. Misunderstanding some requirements and tasks
					happens, but having sprint reviews allow by team members to
					find errors and mistakes I made. Allowing me to fix them
					before errors gets too complicated.
