		SCRUM benefits: <br>
		Daily updates was the one of the biggest benefit for me when developing the project. It allows us to share updates, changes, and ideas in daily meetings over discord. Issues are shared and fixed quickly to keep the progress of the project running effectively.		</div>

		SCRUM benefits: I find SCRUM being very helpful for me, especially sprint reviews. Misunderstanding some requirements and tasks happens, but having sprint reviews allow by team members to find errors and mistakes I made. Allowing me to fix them before errors gets too complicated.		</div>
